# AppCom-Made-in-24-hrs 
AppCom was an App making competition. This was the App made by me[WATCH THE YOUTUBE VIDEO ATTACHED]. I came first in this competition
The task which was given to me - 

 Here, you need to develop a Android Application in Android Studio which must contain following features-
1.A user can login with Facebook, Twitter, and G+.(Without using firebase, use their appropriate Library)

2.After login, a user will get two tabs in tab layout on the home page. One tab will show the form which contains
name, email, mobile number, and image (With appropriate validation) store all the details in the local database.
Another tab will show the list of all the entries did by tab one.
1.Example:- On the first Tab We did entries as follows
ยง Name - Ranveer Singh, Email - ranveer.singh@gmail.com and Mobile number 81090*****.
ยง Name - Priya Prakash, Email - Priya.Prakash@gmail.com and Mobile number 81092*****.
2.Create navigation drawer on the home page. It will show user's profile image and name on top and options like
Logout, View My location, About Us, Contact List and Update profile.

3.Another Tab will reflect all the entries which we did as per the current example it should reflect both the entries
.
4.In View My Location, show user's current location in Map and About Us, show any web page in the web view.

5.Update profile contains the name, email, mobile number and image, Add firebase mobile authentication to verify the
mobile number.

6.Contact List - Save all the contacts in the local database & show list in that tab, Update them once the user made
any changes in contact List.

7.After updating profile, all the change should reflect on the drawer.
